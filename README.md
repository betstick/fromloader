# Yet another FROMSOFT file loader/unloader thing in C++
This one should be better than CFR. I don't know. This may end up lasting about as long before I rewrite it agin.

# Requirements
CMEM
UMEM
CMake

# How to build
Look at CFR-Test repo. It should work.
Should run on Windows and Linux. Don't know how to debug on Windows. So install Linux.
